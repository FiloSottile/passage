======================

This is a very simple password store that encrypts passwords using gpg and
places the encrypted password in a directory. It can generate new passwords
and keep track of old ones.

Visit the project page for more information: http://zx2c4.com/projects/password-store

Please see the man page for documentation and examples.

Depends on:
- gpg2
- git
- xclip
- pwgen
- tree
- GNU getopt
