Harness:

 * Generate new gpg key programatically


Tests to add:

 * pass mv [directory to file]
 * pass mv [file to directory]
 * pass mv [file to file]
 * pass mv [directory to directory]
 * pass mv [X to new directory (by having the argument end in "/")]
 * pass mv [X to existing directory]
 * pass cp [all the above]
 * pass [all the above, but reencrypting when source and destination have different .gpg-id settings]
 * pass init [reencryption with different key]
 * pass grep
 * pass find
 * pass rm
 * pass init -p [plus reencryption with different key]
 * pass insert, pass ls
 * pass insert, pass show
 * pass insert [with -e, with -m, without either]
 * pass insert, cp, mv, rm, generate [with -f, without -f, on existing]
 * pass generate [with -n vs without -n]
 * pass edit [using shm vs not using shm]
 * pass git init
 * git operations on all commands
 * Are empty folders pruned for rm, cp, mv, init (when "" is the argument) [with git, and without git]
 * Are git commits happening as planned? Are they being signed when signing is enabled?
